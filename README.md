# CELEBRITY FACE DETECTOR

1. This is my first proper React project made using create-react-app, the Clarifai API and basic CSS. 

2. The NPM dependencies include tachyons, clarifai and react-icons.

3. The code isn't that clean as this was made in a noobie way, so please consider that aspect.

4. CLick the '?' button in the website to know how to use the app.

5. No React hooks or Redux were used in the project.


## Features :

1. Facial recognition.

2. NSFW content detction.

3. Responsive layout using CSS grid.






## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.




Happy Hacking.
